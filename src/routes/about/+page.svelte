	<h1>About CODE Review</h1>

	<p>
		We are a 100% independent, student-led newspaper built around the community of <a
			href="https://code.berlin">CODE University of Applied Sciences</a
		>. <br />
		We aim to augment the existing communication channels (Slack, Notion, and the Learning Plattform),
		by providing curated long-form content and an overview over current events.
	</p>

	<h2>Keeping you up to date</h2>
	<p>
		We bundle relevant events, deadlines, and announcements in one place. <br />
		Unambiguously and without the spam, unlike Slack.
	</p>

	<h2>Painting a better picture of CODE</h2>
	<p>
		Wondering what people are working on? <br />
		Heard about our campus moving at some point but don't know specifics? <br />
		Didn't know CODE is raising their price every generation? <br />
		CODE Review clears up questions and informs you about everything you'd have to force out of the Student
		Council's mouth.
	</p>

	<h2>Giving students a platform</h2>
	<p>
		Any CODE member may write an article and submit it for review. <br />
		We hope to feature opionion pieces and offer a place for civilized discourse among the community.
